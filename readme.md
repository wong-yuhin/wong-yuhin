11) <b>Capstone Project</b>:
   - Based on a fictional company, Premium House Lights Inc.(PHL), this project consists of three parts: Email to manager, Incident Response Report and a presentation.
     - For the email, the manager of PHL aked for recommendations as they were setting up the security policies and protocols for the company, these recommendations were used to create a robust security policy or the organization.
     - The incident response report is based on a data breach that happened at PHL, in which certain artifacts were analyzed to find out how this data breach happened. Second, a data breach incident response playbook was created based on NIST 7-step incident response process so that PHL will have the steps to respond, contain and remediate a data breach and post-incident recommendations were created for PHL to protect themselves for future incidents.
     - A 5 minute presentation was made to briefly talk about the data breach and some recommendations that can be implemented for PHL to protect themselves against future incidents.
